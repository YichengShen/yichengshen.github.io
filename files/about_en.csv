Yicheng Shen,6,"I'm an ML/AI engineer who enjoys building intelligent systems.","When I'm not training models or shipping products, you'll probably find me lifting, hiking, or experimenting with AI-generated music. I also like turning messy real-world workflows into clean, automated pipelines, especially by building AI tools and agents for financial research and analysis.","I earned my MSE in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, and previously received my BA in Computer Science from Boston College.","In the past, my research focused on designing simulators for distributed machine learning in edge/vehicular-cloud environments and studying fault-tolerant broadcast protocols for modern systems, including cryptocurrency and IoT applications.",
